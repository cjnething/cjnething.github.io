When I was first getting started with JavaScript, I knew absolutely nothing about Chrome developer tools.
A lot of users on Stackoverflow give answers like "just check it in the console," and I had no idea what that meant.

Now that I use Chrome developer tools on a regular basis, I hope to pass on the information that I wish I knew
when I first got started. For many people this is considered very "beginner," but everyone has to start somewhere.
Hope this helps!


This was just an introduction to Chrome Developer Tools, and hopefully it was useful to you. If you have any questions, or if you have any tips for me, please leave a comment or send me an email at cjnething@gmail.com!
